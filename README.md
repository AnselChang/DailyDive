Do you struggle in finding motivation to succeed at your goals? *DailyDive* gamifies building habits by tracking your daily successes and failures in achieving your daily habit goal. Users can create and manage an unlimited number of Habits, where red and green color-coded calendars show how well you’re doing! The satisfying click to turn the day’s square green breaks down impossible goals into daily progress, while progress bars and statistics remind you how far you’ve come since creating your Habit. Don’t struggle on your goals alone! Invite friends to join your Habits, and compete for habit streaks or higher lifetime success rates. Unlock your potential and dive headfirst into success, where every day is a step towards a better you!

*DailyDive* will be developed by Ansel Chang, Sharon Wu, and Kristine Guan, using React and NodeJS Express, and with User and Habit data stored in MongoDB using Mongoose. We will utilize Figma at the start of development to sketch and finalize UI designs, and use Github for collaborative version control.
